1. Create folder structure for basefile
baseurl=file:///repository/_cm5-repo/cloudera-cm5.7.2-centos6/ inside REPOSITORY Folder
2. Download Cloudera Manager Repo from Archive CM, select the version of your choice, and OS type, and place the repo inside "cloudera-cm5.7.2-centos6"
3. Extract the REPO. It will create "cm" directory (I used 7zip to extract the file in case you dont already have a tool to extract in windows. by the way i did it twice.)
4. Similarly, as we downloaded CM, download CDH from Archive, but use Parcels as it is more compressed. Select your prefered version and distribution
